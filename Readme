**Intro**
The role focuses on guiding individuals in developing resumes compatible with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) using generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Google's Bard, and similar solutions. 
While success in securing a job isn't guaranteed, this method significantly enhances resume creation. I've also shared a simple document template that I personally utilize for my resume, 
which can be seamlessly integrated into GitHub.

**Requirement**
To make edits to the document file, you'll need a word processing tool like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer. Any modern browser supports a PDF viewer. 
The job postings you're interested in are often found on the company's career page, LinkedIn, and similar platforms. 
It's essential to exercise patience and modify the GPT prompt below to suit your needs for diverse outcomes. Simply copy and paste your skills into the document, 
and you can find formatting tutorials on YouTube. Don't forget to thoroughly proofread your resume before uploading or applying, as interviewers might inquire about its content.

**What is ATS ?**
ATS, short for applicant tracking system, is a software tool designed to streamline and manage the electronic aspects of recruitment and hiring processes. 
It can be utilized online for both large enterprises and small businesses, with the option of accessing free and open-source ATS software based on the organization's requirements.

**How ATS Works:**

1. ATS simplifies your resume into plain text, like something you'd see in Notepad.
2. It doesn't recognize graphics, images, or text colors.
3. Next, it matches keywordsâ€”think of it like predicting or analyzing sentiments in data science terms.
4. ATS is designed to pull out specific details like your phone number, email, and keywords from responsibilities. 
Sometimes it looks at your qualifications, but don't worry too much about that; a human will read your impressive resume afterward.
