**Intro** 

The role focuses on guiding individuals in developing resumes compatible with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) using generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Google's Bard, and similar solutions.  
While success in securing a job isn't guaranteed, this method significantly enhances resume creation. I've also shared a simple document template that I personally utilize for my resume,  
which can be seamlessly integrated into GitHub. 

  
**Requirement** 

To make edits to the document file, you'll need a word processing tool like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer. Any modern browser supports a PDF viewer.  
The job postings you're interested in are often found on the company's career page, LinkedIn, and similar platforms.  
It's essential to exercise patience and modify the GPT prompt below to suit your needs for diverse outcomes. Simply copy and paste your skills into the document,  
and you can find formatting tutorials on YouTube. Don't forget to thoroughly proofread your resume before uploading or applying, as interviewers might inquire about its content. 
  

**What is ATS ?** 

ATS, short for applicant tracking system, is a software tool designed to streamline and manage the electronic aspects of recruitment and hiring processes.  
It can be utilized online for both large enterprises and small businesses, with the option of accessing free and open-source ATS software based on the organization's requirements. 

  
**How ATS Works:** 

1. ATS simplifies your resume into plain text, like something you'd see in Notepad. 
2. It doesn't recognize graphics, images, or text colors. 
3. Next, it matches keywords—think of it like predicting or analyzing sentiments in data science terms. 
4. ATS is designed to pull out specific details like your phone number, email, and keywords from responsibilities.  
Sometimes it looks at your qualifications, but don't worry too much about that; a human will read your impressive resume afterward. 
 

**Crafting an ATS-Friendly Resume:** 

1. Opt for the always-reliable PDF format for your resume. It ensures accessibility for HR, overcoming issues with word processing software, organizational policies, and varying software versions. PDFs open seamlessly in any browser. 
2. Choose a PDF format that allows copying. Some professional resume services provide locked and uncopiable resumes, making it difficult for ATS to read. Even if OCR technology is in play, spelling mistakes can occur. 
3. Test your PDF resume by opening it, pressing Ctrl + A, then Ctrl + C, and attempting to paste it into Notepad. Successful paste? Great. If not, you might need to reconsider your resume format. 
4. Stick to readable fonts like Calibri or Liberation Sans, maintaining a font size of 11.5 to 12 for the main content and 14 to 16 for headings. 
5. Opt for narrow, visible margins instead of default ones. 
6. Keep your resume concise. Shorter resumes have better chances of making it through HR and ATS screenings. Ideally, limit it to 1 to 2 pages, with a maximum of 2 pages for extensive work experiences. 

7. For multiple job stints, provide detailed information for the last two companies. For older roles, a brief listing with company name, position, and duration will suffice. Here's an example: 

   - XYZ Ltd (2021 - Present)
     City Name
     Responsibilities: Worked on AI, collaborated on projects. 

   - ABC Ltd (2016 - 2021)
     City Name
     Responsibilities: Engaged in word processing and Java development. 

   - TYZ Ltd (2012 - 2021)
     City Name 

   - RTX Ltd (2009 - 2012)
     City Name 

8. Including a photo in your resume is usually unnecessary unless explicitly requested. If needed, opt for a professional and recent Indian passport-size photo, steering clear of outdated 90s-style pictures. 
9. Regarding cover letters, they typically precede the resume. If you decide to include one, I'll guide you on crafting it using GentleAI. This might extend your PDF to 2 to 3 pages, with the first page reserved for the cover letter and the remainder for the resume. Always keep two versions—one with a cover letter and one without (especially for Naukri and LinkedIn profiles or when applying through an organization's career page). 
10. Applying via email? No problem—I've got you covered with guidance on that too using GPT. No need to stress about this part. 
11. Please refrain from adding statements like "I hereby declare the resume is correct" with your signature at the end of your resume. A resume is more of a marketing brochure than a legal document. Many professionals, including resume writers, often include this, but it's entirely unnecessary. 
14. Refrain from providing personal details such as date of birth, zodiac sign, parents' names, family specifics, blood group, height, weight, current salary, and social IDs like PAN card or Aadhaar card in your resume. Save these details for when you secure the job, and HR contacts you for the necessary information. Be cautious, as scammers may try to impersonate HR to obtain such details. Legitimate companies will request these details when the offer letter is about to be released, not during a random call. If a company needs identity proof during an interview, always verify the domain address of the email you receive the interview invite from. 

**Resume Format* 

1. Display your name boldly, sized between 13 to 16. If you prefer, you can exclude the family name. 
2. Provide your contact details, including the city of work, phone number with the country code in the format (+ country code)xxx-xxxx-xxxx, email address, and a professional LinkedIn profile link. Quick tips: 
   a. Shorten your LinkedIn link using this guide: https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a542685/manage-your-public-profile-url 
   b. Ensure your email is professional. For privacy, consider creating a new email address. Avoid unprofessional ones like DudeIlike.beer@xyz.com, Iamtheonlymen.inearth@xyz.com. Opt for a correct format, such as yourname.lastname@xyz.com, yourname.initialfamilyname@xyz.com, or even add a number like 123—e.g., jhon.k@xyz.com, jhon.tim@zyx.com, jhon.tim123@xyz.com. 
2. Craft a concise professional summary—no more than 3-4 lines. This summary should encapsulate your total years of experience and key skills. Ditch the objective section; it's outdated. Your resume itself is a clear statement that you're seeking a job opportunity, so there's no need to explicitly state it as an objective. 
3. Let's delve into your professional journey. (For freshers with no experience, feel free to skip this section. However, if you've completed an internship, I highly recommend utilizing this space.) 
Start by presenting the company name, along with the commencement and conclusion dates (month and year, excluding the day). 
Include the company's location for context. 
Follow this with your job title, optionally adding the grade in brackets for clarity. 
Articulate your responsibilities using concise bullet points—opt for circular bullets, avoiding numbers or letters. 
Highlight your noteworthy projects, specifying the skills and technologies employed in each. This adds depth to your professional narrative. 

Example: 
[Company Name] | [City, State] | [Jan 2019 - Present] 
Business Analyst 

Led the development of a real-time performance dashboard, reducing turnaround time for key metrics by 30% and improving decision-making capabilities. 
Collaborated with cross-functional teams to identify and implement process improvements, resulting in a 15% increase in operational efficiency. 
Analyzed customer data to identify trends and recommend marketing strategies, leading to a 10% growth in customer conversion rate. 
Supported the implementation of an AI-powered recommendation engine, personalized user experience, and boosted customer satisfaction by 25%. 
Note: Here's a life hack for you—incorporate a few technical skills in this section, like SQL or Python. Bold them. While this doesn't impact ATS, it catches the interviewer's eye. Human behavior tends to focus on highlighted words, sparking questions during interviews. This hack can also assist in streamlining resumes during HR screenings. Remember, if you've already mentioned skills within your job roles and responsibilities, there's no need to repeat them in the dedicated skills section. Use this space to showcase additional skills. 

4. Skills  

Skills take the lead for experienced professionals, making them the first section in your resume, followed by Certificates and Education. However, for freshers, the sequence is reversed—kick off with Education, then Certificates, and finally, showcase your Skills. 
Enrich your resume with a blend of soft and technical skills, employing a bar to enhance its searchability and facilitate HR screening—think of it as the SEO for your resume. Stick to 3-5 skills in concise bullet points, ensuring a well-balanced mix. 
Feel free to use the | symbol for additional skills. Here are examples for both scenarios: 

Example 1: 
Communication 
Leadership 
Java 
HTML 

Example 2: 
Communication | Leadership 
Java | HTML 

5. Certifications 

Don't go overboard with certifications—quality over quantity is key. Limit it to a maximum of 3-4 certifications, just like in examples 1 and 2.

6. Education 

This section holds significant weight. For experienced professionals, prioritize your degree names; details about schooling (12th and 10th grades) are less critical as HR is already aware of these basics. 
Format it like this: Specify the full name of the institution (avoid abbreviations), followed by the city name in brackets and the year of graduation. The start date is not crucial. Present the degree's full name, and format the information in bullet points for clarity. 

 ABC Institute of Business, XYZ City (2016) 
 Master of Business Administration – Finance and Leadership 

7. Hobbies: 

While optional, this section can serve as an icebreaker, creating a connection with the interviewer. Apply the same principle—opt for quality over quantity. Showcase 3-4 genuine hobbies, akin to examples 1 and 2. Avoid fabricating interests, as my experience has shown that this can lead to rejection. 
Hobbies can span from outdoor to indoor activities, including TV series, anime, or video games. Be well-prepared to explain why you enjoy these activities and how they contribute to your personal and professional growth. Present your hobbies in bullet points, aligning with the format used in previous sections. 

8. Languages 

This section holds significance; refrain from including fake languages, as discussed in the Hobbies section. List languages you genuinely know and prefer. Sometimes, language skills can be crucial for a job or serve as a point of shared interest, fostering connections. 

**Cover Letter** 

Think of a cover letter as your professional introduction—it's like the opening act to your resume when you're applying for a job. Unlike a love letter, keep it formal yet add a touch of personality. Skip the unnecessary details and avoid mentioning specific job titles or company names to make it more versatile. Instead, highlight your years of experience, key skills, and briefly talk about your current and past roles (limit it to two companies). It's a snapshot of why you're the perfect fit for the job and the company. Max page allowed is one. 

**Cover Letter Format** 

Kick off your cover letter with the basics: your name and contact details, just like the initial section of your resume. Take a moment with a line break and open the letter with a warm "Hello." Steer clear of overly casual greetings like 'Hi,' 'Dear,' 'Whatsapp,' or 'Yo.' 
Transition smoothly into the context of your cover letter, wrapping it up with a gracious "Thanks" and your name. No need to repeat your contact details; you've already covered that at the beginning. 

**Prompt For Chat Generative AI** 

Now, let's dive into why we're using generative AI, starting with crafting your resume. Hopefully, you've got your old resume or a rough draft ready, along with a few job profiles you're eyeing. Remember, to safeguard your privacy, avoid including personal details like your name, contact information, company names, or educational institutions. Instead, use placeholder names and words that you can replace when editing your resume. Take the necessary steps to ensure privacy, and if there's a privacy statement associated with the generative AI you're using—whether it's GPT, Bard, or any other—make sure to give it a visit. It's your responsibility to safeguard your privacy. 

Please read Privacy and Policy statement before using this.
